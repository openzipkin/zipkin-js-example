# Hapi example

This project shows how to use zipkin.js in a Hapi context with both sync and parallel async calls.

## Usage

You need to run a local zipkin server, for example by running `docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin`

Then, `npm install` to get latest dependencies.
Run `node index.js` to start the server.
