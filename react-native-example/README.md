# React Native Example
 
This project shows how to use zipkin.js in a React Native context.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Usage
You need to run a local zipkin server, for example by running `docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin` and you need to change the `HOST` variables in [App.js](App.js)
